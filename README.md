# Encode-decode

This project involves encoding and decoding algorithms based on binary numbers in the range 0 -15. 
In circle.png consider the solid circle to be divided into 4 equal pies and consider them 0,1,2,3.
Refer to the image below-

Now, each pie should represent a binary value and position index refers to the value to be
selected from the binary number.

For exmaple if the entered number is 10 the below image is returned as output

Decoding involves returning the decimal value of the encoded image. The decoding is dynamic in nature and not based on pixel values.
